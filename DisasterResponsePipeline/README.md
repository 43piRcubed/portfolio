## 1 Overview

In this project disaster response data from <a href="https://www.figure-eight.com/" target="_blank">Figure Eight</a> is analyzed to build a model for an API that allows for the classification of disaster messages based on 36 different categories.

The aim is to categorize messages received to facilitate the notification to the appropriate disaster relief agencies .

On the back end the data is processed and modeled.  The front end is a web app that allows an emergency operator to enter a message, which will then be categorized accordingly to allow for the appropriate actions to be taken.

The main dashboard of the app also includes visualizations that summarize the data used as modelling input. 

[Here](#flask) are a few screenshots of the web app.

## 2. Project Components

There are three components of this project:
-  an ETL pipeline
-  a Machine Leanring pipeline
-  a flask app

<a id='etl_'></a>

### 2.1. ETL Pipeline

File _data/process_data.py_ contains data cleaning pipeline that:

- Loads the `messages` and `categories` dataset
- Merges the two datasets
- Cleans the data
- Stores it in a **SQLite database**

<a id='ml_'></a>

### 2.2. ML Pipeline

File _models/train_classifier.py_ contains machine learning pipeline that:

- Loads data from the **SQLite database**
- Splits the data into training and testing sets
- Builds a text processing and machine learning pipeline
- Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV
- Outputs result on the test set
- Exports the final model as a pickle file

### 2.3. Flask App

<a id='eg'></a>

Running [this command](#com) **from app directory** will start the web app where users can enter their query, i.e., a request message sent during a natural disaster, e.g. _"Please, we need tents and water. We are in Silo, Thank you!"_.

**_Screenshot 1  -  Main Dashboard_**

What the app will do is that it will classify the text message into categories so that appropriate relief agency can be reached out for help.

## 3. Running

There are three steps to get up and runnning with the web app if you want to start from ETL process.

<a id='cleaning'></a>

### 3.1. Data Cleaning

**Go to the project directory** and the run the following command:

```bat
python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db
```

The first two arguments are input data and the third argument is the SQLite Database in which we want to save the cleaned data. The ETL pipeline is in _process_data.py_.

_DisasterResponse.db_ already exists in _data_ folder but the above command will still run and replace the file with same information.

### 3.2. Training Classifier

After the data cleaning process, run this command **from the project directory**:

```bat
python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl
```

This will use cleaned data to train the model, improve the model with grid search and saved the model to a pickle file (_classifer.pkl_).

_classifier.pkl_ already exists but the above command will still run and replace the file will same information.

_**Screenshot 4**_

![train_classifier_1](img/train_classifier_1.jpg)

It took me around **4 minutes** to train the classifier with grid search.

When the models is saved, it will look something like this.

<a id='starting'></a>

### 3.3. Starting the web app

Now that we have cleaned the data and trained our model. Now it's time to see the prediction in a user friendly way.

**Go the app directory** and run the following command:

<a id='com'></a>

```bat
python run.py
```

This will start the web app and will direct you to a URL where you can enter messages and get classification results for it.

## 4. Conclusion

Some information about training data set as seen on the main page of the web app.

**_Screenshot 7_**

![genre](img/genre.jpg)

**_Screenshot 8_**

![dist](img/dist.jpg)

As we can see the data is highly imbalanced. Though the accuracy metric is [high](#acc) (you will see the exact value after the model is trained by grid search, it is ~0.94), it has a poor value for recall (~0.6). So, take appropriate measures when using this model for decision-making process at a larger scale or in a production environment.

## 7. Credits

Thanks <a href="https://www.udacity.com" target="_blank">Udacity</a> for letting me use their logo as favicon for this web app.

Another <a href="https://medium.com/udacity/three-awesome-projects-from-udacitys-data-scientist-program-609ff0949bed" target="_blank">blog post</a> was a great motivation to improve my documentation. This post discusses some of the cool projects from <a href="https://in.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025" target="_blank">Data Scientist Nanodegree</a> students. This really shows how far we can go if we apply the concepts learned beyond the classroom content to build something that inspire others.
